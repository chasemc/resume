	abstract = {Most state and provincial fish and wildlife agencies have access to important information about patterns in sportsperson participation through their license databases. Using transaction data from Nebraska Game and Parks Commission's electronic hunting and fishing license system, we tracked license purchases of Nebraska, USA, resident license holders in 2010 through 2017. We categorized sportspersons by gender and yearly purchases as hunting only (Hunter), fishing only (Angler), a combination of hunting and fishing (Hunter–Angler), or no purchases (Inactive). The probability of movement among active sportsperson groups was limited and varied little based on initial group participation. The Angler group had the greatest probability of an individual transitioning to the Inactive group (females = 0.39; males = 0.33). The Hunter–Angler group had the greatest probability of an individual remaining within the same group (females = 0.65; males = 0.76). There was a relatively low probability of an individual in the Hunter group moving to the Angler group and vice versa (≤0.02). The sportsperson population is dynamic and understanding patterns of sportsperson participation is important for the future of fish and wildlife management in North America. Using data readily available to most fish and wildlife agencies has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of hunter and angler participation and aid management agencies and conservation organizations in the development of more effective strategies for managing sportspersons. © 2020 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {State fish and wildlife agencies rely on hunters and anglers (i.e., sportspersons) to fund management actions through revenue generated from license sales and excise taxes on hunting and fishing equipment. There is a need to develop new techniques that bridge the information gap on participation and provide agencies with an understanding of sportspersons at a resolution that can more directly inform efforts to engage sportspersons. Monitoring sportsperson participation using information about their license-purchasing behavior has the potential to reveal important patterns in recruitment (first-time purchase of a hunting or fishing license), retention (continued purchase of licenses across multiple years), and reactivation (purchase a license after several years with no purchases). Providing up-to-date information on what licenses are purchased, when and by whom may prove invaluable to managers and policy makers. We present a customizable, open-source, web-based application—huntfishapp—that allows the user to query and interact with a structured query language (SQL) hunting and fishing license database. The huntfishapp serves as an informational resource and tool that provides a framework to share information on license sales across an agency, with intent of increasing understanding of (a) sportspersons and (b) how management decisions affect sportspersons. Data dashboards, like the huntfishapp, allow agencies and non-governmental organizations to become more knowledgeable of their customer base and provide a greater understanding of management-decision effects on hunting and fishing participation.},

The method is illustrated on a cantilever beam bending example and then a sounding rocket example. It is shown that redesign acts as a type of quality control measure to prevent an undesirable initial design from being accepted as the final design. It is found that the optimal design/redesign strategy for maximizing expected design performance includes not only redesign to correct an initial design that is later revealed to be unsafe, but also redesign to improve performance when an initial design is later revealed to be too conservative (e.g. too heavy).},

Thesis (Ph. D.)--University of Florida, 2016
At the initial design stage, engineers often rely on low-fidelity models that have high uncertainty. Model uncertainty is reducible and is classified as epistemic uncertainty; uncertainty due to variability is irreducible and classified as aleatory uncertainty. In a deterministic safety-margin-based design approach, uncertainty is implicitly compensated for by using fixed conservative values in place of aleatory variables and ensuring the design satisfies a safety-margin with respect to design constraints. After an initial design is selected, testing (e.g. physical experiment or high-fidelity simulation) is performed to reduce epistemic uncertainty and ensure the design achieves the targeted levels of safety. Testing is used to calibrate low-fidelity models and prescribe redesign when tests are not passed. After calibration, reduced epistemic model uncertainty can be leveraged through redesign to restore safety or improve design performance; however, redesign may be associated with substantial costs or delays. In this work, the possible effects of a future test and redesign are considered while the initial design is optimized using only a low-fidelity model. The goal is to develop a general method for the integrated optimization of the design, testing, and redesign process that allows for the tradeoff between the risk of future redesign and the associated performance and reliability benefits. This is accomplished by formulating the design, testing, and redesign process in terms of safety-margins and optimizing these margins based on expected performance, expected probability of failure, and probability of redesign. The first objective of this study is to determine how the degree of conservativeness in the initial design relates to the expected design performance after a test and possible redesign. The second objective is to develop a general method for modeling epistemic model uncertainty and calibration when simulating a possible future test and redesign. The third objective is to apply the method of simulating a future test and redesign to a sounding rocket design example},

Chapter 3 analyzes the dilemma of whether to start with a more conservative initial design and possibly redesign for performance or to start with a less conservative initial design and risk redesigning to restore safety. Chapter 4 develops a generalized method for simulating a future test and possible redesign that accounts for spatial correlations in the epistemic model error. Chapter 5 discusses the application of the method to the design of a sounding rocket under mixed epistemic model uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty. Chapter 6 concludes the work.},

	abstract = {Early in the design process, there is often mixed epistemic model uncertainty and aleatory parameter uncertainty. Later in the design process, the results of high-fidelity simulations or experiments will reduce epistemic model uncertainty and may trigger a redesign process. Redesign is undesirable because it is associated with costs and delays; however, it is also an opportunity to correct a dangerous design or possibly improve design performance. In this study, we propose a margin-based design/redesign method where the design is optimized deterministically, but the margins are selected probabilistically. The final design is an epistemic random variable (i.e., it is unknown at the initial design stage) and the margins are optimized to control the epistemic uncertainty in the final design, design performance, and probability of failure. The method allows for the tradeoff between expected final design performance and probability of redesign while ensuring reliability with respect to mixed uncertainties. The method is demonstrated on a simple bar problem and then on an engine design problem. The examples are used to investigate the dilemma of whether to start with a higher margin and redesign if the test later in the design process reveals the design to be too conservative, or to start with a lower margin and redesign if the test reveals the design to be unsafe. In the examples in this study, it is found that this decision is related to the variance of the uncertainty in the high-fidelity model relative to the variance of the uncertainty in the low-fidelity model.},

These disciplines are tightly coupled and may involve antagonistic objectives that require the use of specific methodologies in order to assess trade-offs between the disciplines and to obtain the global optimal configuration. Generally, there are two ways to handle the system design. On the one hand, the design may be considered from a disciplinary point of view (a.k.a. Disciplinary Design Optimization): the designer of each discipline has to design its subsystem (e.g. engine) taking the interactions between its discipline and the others (interdisciplinary couplings) into account. On the other hand, the design may also be considered as a whole: the design team addresses the global architecture of the space vehicle, taking all the disciplinary design variables and constraints into account at the same time. This methodology is known as Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) and requires specific mathematical tools to handle the interdisciplinary coupling consistency.},
